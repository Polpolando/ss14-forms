# Polando's SS14 forms
Highly inspired and uses elements of [Moomoobeef/ss14-forms-txt](https://github.com/Moomoobeef/ss14-forms-txt). 
This is my personal collection of forms I've made while playing on Funky and Ron.
## Instructions
### Fax Machine
1. Clone the repo or download a form you want to print.
2. Open fax, press print file.
3. Select a form.
### No Fax Machine
1. Get a paper and a pen.
2. Copy the content of a form file.
3. Paste it into the paper in game
4. Remove the first line starting with a '#'

## Document Structure
Each document has an ID consisting of a two letter prefix and a three letter suffix, e.g., "RQ-ACS" for a request form about access. The prefix indicates the type of document, while the suffix is a unique identifier for that specific form.
### Document Prefix Codes
| Code  | Meaning          | Description                                                   |
|-------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| RQ    | Request          | Requests for something, like access or items. |
| RP    | Report           | Reports of various situations or incidents. |
| PR    | Permit           | Various permissions like contraband or building. |
| AP    | Application      | Like requests but they require bit more consideration. |
| QS    | Questionnaire    | Surveys or questionnaires for feedback or for sillies. |
| WR    | Warrant          | Legal documents for security. |
| IN    | Inspection       | Lists of things to inspect in a department. | 
| MS    | Miscellaneous    | Miscellaneous forms that don't fit other categories. | 
| LT    | Letter           | Formal letters for various purposes. | 

More prefixes can be added as needed, but contributions should use existing ones where possible.
### Document Suffix Codes
They are unique identifiers for each form, usually three letters long. They can be anything, but should be descriptive of the form's content. For example, "ACS" for access, "DEP" for department, etc.

## Contribution
Contributions welcome. Fork the repository, add or edit forms, and submit a pull request. Ensure forms are plain text (.txt) and include a # label for easy document titles in-game.\
They should also follow the naming convention of two-letter prefix and three-letter suffix, preferably using one of the existing prefixes.

## License
Use freely. Download, modify, or distribute as you want lol. WTFPL FTW.
